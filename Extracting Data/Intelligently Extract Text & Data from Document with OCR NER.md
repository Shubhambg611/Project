Intelligently Extract Text & Data from Document with OCR NER

In the digital age, contact information is a crucial part of business communication. One of the most common forms of contact information exchange is through the use of visiting cards. However, manually inputting the information from a visiting card can be a tedious and time-consuming task.

In order to streamline this process, This project utilizes Pytesseract and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract essential contact information such as name, phone number, address, designation, website, email, and organization from a visiting card.

Pytesseract is a Python library that provides an interface for using Google's Tesseract OCR engine to recognize text in images. With the help of OCR, we can extract the text from the visiting card image and then use Pytesseract to process the text and extract the relevant information.

The extracted information can then be stored in a structured format for easy access and use. This project aims to provide a fast, accurate, and efficient solution for extracting contact information from visiting cards, reducing the need for manual data entry and improving productivity.

The proposed system will work as follows: Input: The user will provide an image of a visiting card in any format like JPG, PNG, or PDF. The image can be captured using a mobile phone camera or scanned using a scanner.

Preprocessing: The system will preprocess the image to enhance the quality of the image. It will remove noise, blur, and other unwanted elements from the image.

OCR: The system will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize the text on the visiting card. Pytesseract is a widely used OCR engine in the Python community. The system will use Pytesseract to extract text from the image.

Information Extraction: After extracting text from the visiting card, the system will use regular expressions to extract essential information like name, phone number, address, designation, website, email, and organization. The system will use predefined patterns for each type of information.

Stage -1: We will setup the project by doing the necessary installations and requirements.

Stage -2: We will do data preparation. That is we will extract text from images using Pytesseract and also do necessary cleaning.

Stage -3: We will see how to label NER data using BIO tagging.

Stage -4: We will further clean the text and preprocess the data for to train machine learning.

Stage -5: With the preprocess data we will train the Named Entity model.

Stage -6: We will predict the entitles using NER and model and create data pipeline for parsing text.

CONCLUSION!

The proposed system will be a powerful solution for automating the process of extracting information from visiting cards. It will save time and effort in managing contacts and help users to keep their contact information up to date. The system will be accurate, fast, scalable, user-friendly, and customizable.
